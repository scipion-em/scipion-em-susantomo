3.0b2: fix the test when emantomo is missing
3.0b1:
    - viewer working
    - continue mode refactored
    - more mra params added
    - subset protocol added
3.0a1:
    - FSC and CC viewers tbd
    - input subtomo alignments are ignored by Susan Python API at the moment
    - input TS must be aligned. Susan Python API is missing the import of *.xf alignments at the moment
    - continue mode support is limited (you cant "continue of the continue"). This will be refactored once output alignments can be saved for subtomos
    - first version of the plugin
